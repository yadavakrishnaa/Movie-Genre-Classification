  Movie Genre Classification
</h1>
<p>
  Movie genre classification is a task in which a machine learning model is trained to predict the genre of a movie based on its features. These features can include information about the plot, characters, and other elements of the movie. The model is trained using a dataset of movies, where the genre of each movie is known. The goal of the project is to build a model that is able to accurately predict the genre of a movie based on its features. This can be useful for various applications, such as recommending movies to users based on their preferred genres or improving the organization and search-ability of movies within a media library. The project may involve using techniques such as feature engineering, model selection in order to optimize the performance of the model.
